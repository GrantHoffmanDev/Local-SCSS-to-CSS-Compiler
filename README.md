# Local-SCSS-to-CSS-Compiler
This is a basic SCSS to CSS compiler.
What this does is it compiles the scss file from the scss folder into css files in the css folder, thus why the scss and css are there.

To use the SCSS to CSS compiler:
1. Use a command line to run the compiler.
2. Navigate to the folder with the compiler in the command prompt.
3. Run command "npm install node-sass" without the quotes to install the Sass node.
3. While in the folder, use command "npm run scss" without the quotes to now watch the scss file.

If you run into issues with the compiler, you may need to install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/).
